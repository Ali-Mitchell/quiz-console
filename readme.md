# Quiz Console

##Notes for TA's 
I am just checking on this after I submitted it and the live site is not updating despite all the correct code/ finsihed product being pushed up 12 hours ago. I am troubleshooting the issue now. All of the code in my repo is correct to what I want submitted for my grade, I just need to understand the discrepancies between the git hub page and the rep. 

## Purpose
A quiz interface where a user is given a prompt to answer a question with options displayed on buttons. These buttons log correct or wrong answers and affect the user's timer. A timer counts down from 60 seconds and a penalty of -10 seconds is given with a wrong answer. At the end of the quiz the user is given their overall score based on time remaining and their correct answers. They are prompted to fill out a form with their initials to log their score and have an option to view high scores saved in local storage.
